* Overview
This is a simple Discord music bot built utilizing Python, Docker, and yt-dlp. I made this bot to self host it on my Unraid server, but you can host it without Unraid as well as long as you have Docker.

* Installation

** Docker Install
1. Pull the Docker image:
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   docker pull sticio/discord-music-bot
   #+END_SRC

2. Run the bot with your token:
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   docker run -e DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN="your-token-here" sticio/discord-music-bot
   #+END_SRC

** Installation On Unraid
1. Open the **Unraid Web UI**.
2. Go to the **Docker** tab and click **Add Container**.
3. Set the **Repository** to: sticio/discord-music-bot
4. Under **Environment Variables**, add:
- **Key**: `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`
- **Value**: `your-bot-token-here`
5. Click **Apply** and start the container.
